# News Titles Categorization using Naive Bayes Classifier
* In this project I implemented a Naive Bayes text classifier to categorize the titles of news. The categories are:
- kijgit
- itgjot
* Zeros have been handles by Laplacian smoothing.
* `DataPreprocessor` class has been designed for data preprocessing and the aim of `NaiveBayesClassifier` is training and predicting the Naive Bayes model to do the classification task.

# News Titles Categorization using Naive Bayes Classifier
* This project is a text classification. In this project I implemented a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch for categorizing the News Tiltles.
* Zeros have been handles by Laplacian smoothing.
* DataPreprocessor class designed for data preprocessing phase and NaiveBayesClassifier designed for classification task.
